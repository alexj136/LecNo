\noindent This report will detail the implementation of a multi-layer perceptron and a radial basis function network, in order to predict house prices in the Boston area, a benchmark problem in the field. \\
\indent The implementation is written in Python. No Neural Network libraries or toolkits were used to implement MLP or RBFN, however the Matplotlib.mlab library was used to perform principal component analysis. Matplotlib and Numpy were used to produce graphs.
