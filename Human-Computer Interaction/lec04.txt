User Research Methods
====================

Why?
  Understand user values, priorities, behaviours
  listen to what people need
  get users involved early

What?
Asking people:
  Interviews
  Focus groups
  Questionaires & surveys
Observing people:
  Controlled observation
  'in the field'
Other:
  user diaries
  biometrics
  logs/anylitics

Interviews
  Ideally face to face
  Recorded/Transcribed
  Who do we interview?
    user/potential user
    stakeholder
  Interviewer:
    Member of design team
    dedicated researcher
  Interview type:
    Unstructured - exploratory, conversational
    Semi-structured - guide questions etc, follow-ups
    Highly-structured - Tight script, no deviation. Highly replicable
  Benefits:
    versatile, flexible
    collect rich data
    exploratory
  Drawbacks:
    Expensive, time-consuming
    users may not have required level of knowledge

Focus Groups
  Benefits:
    Efficient - hear from many people
    Encourage participants to talk freely
    Idea generation
    Consensus can emerge
  Drawbacks:
    Depends on skill of facilitator
    Dominant participants drown out others
    less in-depth 

Questionnaires
  Benefits:
    highly replicable
    less expensive
    less time-consuming
  Drawbacks:
    Hard to get questions right
    Trolling/nonsense answers 
    no feedback to participant
    people give up
  Closed questions:
    fixed set of answers
    yes or no
    rating scale
    check boxes
  Open ended questions:
    harder/more time consuming to analyse

What makes a bad quesion?
  Leads user to certain answer
  Makes assumptions
  Multiple questions rolled into one
  Uses jargon

Good Questions
  Mixture of closed & open ended
  Specifics: who/what/where/when/why/how
  Use probes at the end: Do you have any other comments?

Observation
  Controlled:
    Good to discover specific info
    Ask someone to think aloud while using product
    Can make participants feel self-concious
  Uncontrolled:
    'in the field'
    Different approaches: close/far, long/short etc
  Benefits:
    Reveals info that asking questions cannot
    info on context you're desiging for 
    Fill in details
  Drawbacks
    Invasive
