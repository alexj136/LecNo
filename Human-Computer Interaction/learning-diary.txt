Week 1

I was initially quite skeptical about the HCI module, I tend to prefer more
mathematical subjects, where concepts are objective rather than subjective. I
have typically done better in those kinds of modules. To be honest the first
week of HCI has not put me at ease. 'Good' and 'Bad' design are concepts that
are very difficult to pin down and I worry that if I am required to identify
such things in an exam I will not do well.
	I thought it was interesting to see the lecture slides with pictures of old
computer systems, like the punch-card computer at NASA and the old Apple Mac
computer. I would like to hear the lecturer's thoughts on punch card systems. I
would also like to know if she has any ideas about programming languages in
relation to HCI. Perhaps I will send an email.
