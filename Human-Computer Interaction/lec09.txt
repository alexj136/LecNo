Emotional & Social Interaction

User Experience vs Usability:
How the user 'feels' vs a more concrete scientific idea

Sometimes we want to design for 'negative' emotions
    - i.e fear, frustration in a video game
    - This is highly dependent on the application

Usability can conflict with user experience e.g. Microsoft Clippy - potentially
assists the user but distracts and irritates, spoiling the experience
