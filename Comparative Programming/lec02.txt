Comparative Programming - Lecture 2
===================================

A pure functional programming language has:
    
    Unicity of normal forms: The value of an expression is uniquely determined
    by its components, and is independent of order of reduction
    
    Non-termination: Not all reduction sequences lead to a value, some reduction
    sequences do not terminate
