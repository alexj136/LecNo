Currification: passing arguments one at a time.

(+) is a currified version of +.

+ :: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
(+) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer

type variables have a quantity: the universal quantifier
Types can be Monomorphic: every expression has at most one type, or:
             Polymorphic: some expressions have at more than one type

Polymorphism: The SAME code for every type
Overloading: The same operator names, executing different code depending on the
             types of the argument
